# How to install? 
First you need connect your electronic board by USB. After you need check what's number COM?
Next step you need download this repo and try control led feature.

    ```
        <?php 
            require_once __DIR__ . '/Defines/pinMode.php';
            require_once __DIR__ . '/Adapters/USBConnecting.php';
            require_once __DIR__ . '/Hardware/HardwareFactory.php';
            use PIOT\USBConnecting\USBConnectingFactory;
            use PIOT\Hardware\Factory\HardwareFactory;

            $usbFactory = new USBConnectingFactory();
            $connect = $usbFactory->create(true);
            $connect->setSerial(3);
            $connect->setBAUD(9600);
            $connect->setReceiveDelay(3);

            $hardwareFactory = new HardwareFactory();
            $led = $hardwareFactory->createLed();
            $led->high();
            $connect->setMessage($led->currentMode());
            $connect->send();
            echo $connect->receive() . ' | ';

            sleep(3);
            $led->low();
            $connect->setMessage($led->currentMode());
            $connect->send();
            echo $connect->receive() . ' | ';
            sleep(3);
    ```
